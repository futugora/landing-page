            <p><strong>Last Updated: September 1, 2025</strong></p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to KeyBard ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the KeyBard macOS application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a clear understanding of how the App operates.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
            <p>We believe in privacy by design. The KeyBard App is built to be a simple, standalone utility that operates entirely on your device. We do not collect, store, record, or transmit any personal data or usage analytics from the App. Specifically, we do not have access to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MIDI Data:</strong> Any MIDI information generated by your keyboard or musical instruments is processed in real-time by the App on your local machine and is never sent to us or any third party.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio Data:</strong> The audio generated by the App and any Audio Unit (AU) plugins you use is processed locally on your device and is never recorded or transmitted.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> We do not track how you use the App, which plugins you use, what presets you select, or how often you use it.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> The App does not require you to create an account, provide your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How the App Works</h2>
            <p>KeyBard functions as a host for Audio Unit (AUv3) instrument plugins installed on your macOS system. It acts as a bridge, receiving MIDI input from your connected devices and routing it to the selected AU plugin. All of this processing occurs in real-time, exclusively on your computer.</p>
            <p>The App saves your last-used plugin and preset combination. This information is stored locally on your device in the App's preferences and is not accessible to us.</p>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Plugins</h2>
            <p>While KeyBard itself does not collect data, any third-party Audio Unit plugins you use within the App are subject to their own respective privacy policies. We are not responsible for the data practices of third-party plugins. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any AU plugins you use.</p>

            <h2>5. App Store</h2>
            <p>The KeyBard App is distributed exclusively through the Apple App Store. Apple may collect sales and usage data as part of their service, which is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy. We do not have access to any personal data related to your purchase or download of the App through the App Store.</p>

            <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised policy. We encourage you to review this page periodically for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
